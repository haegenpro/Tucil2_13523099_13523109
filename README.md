# Quadtree Image Compression Program
## Tucil 2 IF2211 Strategi Algoritma

The Quadtree Image Compression Program provides a robust solution for reducing image file sizes using a quadtree-based approach. It works by recursively subdividing an image into smaller blocks based on color similarity and various error metricsâ€”including Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Maximum Pixel Difference (MPD), Variance, Entropy, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). This standard functionality compresses the image efficiently while preserving essential visual details.

## Overview

In addition to its core compression capabilities, the program offers advanced bonus features for enhanced performance and user experience. These include:

- **Target Compression Percentage:** Users can specify a desired reduction in file size. The algorithm then employs a binary search method to adjust the quadtree threshold optimally, ensuring that the compressed image meets the targeted compression ratio.
- **GIF Visualization:** An animated GIF is generated to visually document the compression process. This feature provides a dynamic illustration of the quadtree's progressive subdivision and merging, offering valuable insights into how the algorithm refines the image.

Together, the standard and bonus features enable a balanced approach between achieving significant file size reduction and maintaining high image quality.

## Requirements & Installation

### Requirements

- **C++ Compiler:** A compiler supporting C++17 (e.g., GCC 7+, Clang 7+, or MSVC 2019 or later)
- **CMake:** (Optional) for building the project automatically
- **Additional Libraries:**
  - [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for image processing
  - [stb_image_write](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for writing images to files
  - [gif](https://github.com/charlietangora/gif-h/blob/master/gif.h) for writing and reading GIF files

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/quadtree-compression.git
   cd quadtree-compression
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies (if necessary):**

    Ensure that the stb_image and stb_image_write libraries are available.
    For Linux systems, install build essentials and CMake:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
    ```

## Compiling the Program

### Using CMake

1. **Create a Build Directory and Navigate Into It:**

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

2. **Generate Build Files Using CMake:**

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

3. **Build the Program:**

    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```
    The compiled program will be located in the build directory.

### Using G++ Manually

If you prefer not to use CMake, compile manually with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o quadtree_compressor src/driver.cpp src/image.cpp src/ssim.cpp src/compressor.cpp src/quadtree.cpp -lm
```

Ensure that your directory structure matches the source file layout.

## Running and Using the Program

1. **Run the Program via Terminal:**

    ```bash
    ./quadtree_compressor
    ```

2. **Follow the Interactive Prompts:**

    a. **Enter the file path of the image to be compressed.**  
    b. **Choose an error measurement method (e.g., SSIM, MAD, etc.).**  
    c. **Provide a threshold value and minimum block size.**  
    d. **Specify a target compression ratio (e.g., 0.3 for a 30% reduction in file size).**  
    e. **Enter the output file path for the compressed image.**  
    f. **Optionally, provide a GIF output file path to see the compression animation.**  
    g. **Output: The program displays information such as execution time, original and compressed file sizes, and the achieved compression percentage.**  

3. **Example Output:**

    ```bash
    Enter input file path: original_image.png
    Enter threshold: 0.05
    Enter minimum block size: 4
    Enter target compression ratio: 0.3
    Enter output file path: compressed_image.png
    Enter GIF file path: animation.gif
    Time taken for compression: 1.23 seconds
    Initial image size: 2048000 bytes
    Compressed image size: 512000 bytes
    Compression percentage: 75%
    Depth of QuadTree: 6
    Image saved to: compressed_image.png
    GIF saved to: animation.gif
    ```
